# Fake-News-Detection

•	The motive was to detect fake news using NLP MODELS.
•	We used three different techniques to create word embeddings, 1. Count vectorizer 2. Tfidf vectorizer 3. Word embeddings.
•	Basic models used:- Multinomial Naive Bayes(MNB), Logistic Regression(LR), Decision Trees(DT), Random Forests(RF).
•	Deep learning models:- LSTM + one-hot, LSTM + Glove, BiLSTM, CNN + Glove.
